# PROGRAMING AND SCRIPTING
# PROJECT
## AUTHOR: ANTE DUJIC

This repository contains the code written as a project for Programing and Scripting Module. The project is to show how Pyton can be used to analyse the Iris flower data set.

## **INTRODUCTION**

The Iris flower data set, aslo called Fisher's Iris data set, is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. The dataset consists of 150 instances, made up of 50 samples each of 3 species of iris.

There were 4 features measured from each sample:
1. Sepal length in cm's
2. Sepal width in cm's
3. Petal length in cm's
4. Petal width in cm's

Based on the combination of these four features, we can distinguish 3 species of iris:
1. Iris Setosa
2. Iris Versicolour
3. Iris Virginica

The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.


## **DATASET ANALYSIS**

Many others have done the analysis of the Iris Dataset before and it has been aproached in many different ways. Further in this Readme file will be explained how Python can be used to achive the same.

### **LIBRARIES**

Python Libraries are a set of useful functions that eliminate the need for writing codes from scratch. There are over 137,000 python libraries present today. Libraries used for this analysis are listed below.

*CODE:*
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

- **NumPy** - the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.
- **Pandas** -  a library for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
- **Matplotlib.pyplot** - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.
- **Seaborn** - a data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
