## **INTRODUCTION**

The Iris flower data set, aslo called Fisher's Iris data set, is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. The dataset consists of 150 instances, made up of 50 samples each of 3 species of iris.

There were 4 features measured from each sample:
1. Sepal length in cm's
2. Sepal width in cm's
3. Petal length in cm's
4. Petal width in cm's

Based on the combination of these four features, we can distinguish 3 species of iris:
1. Iris Setosa
2. Iris Versicolour
3. Iris Virginica

The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.
